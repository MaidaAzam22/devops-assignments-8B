Project Details
Description

The Smart Car Parking System is using ANPR which enables the easy entry of cars in Parking lot.
Our app has features in it that enable you to easily enter the Parking Lot and find the car parking slot and pay through the app rather than manually taking a ticket and paying. Parker just has to register his Cars(s) in the system and then can easily park the car and pay from the app.
Our system also provides help to the parking management as they will have their Web Dashboard where they can see all the records, manage things easily such as parking rates and can also keep surveillance. This system automates all the efforts which parking managements have to do physically.
